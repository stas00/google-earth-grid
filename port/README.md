# Port of Earth Grid Research scripts

These are scripts from [Earth Grid Research](https://montalk.net/science/115/earth-grid-research) [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200921223946/https://montalk.net/science/115/earth-grid-research) - written in 2006 in python 2, and are now ported to python 3.

I did just the bare minimum to make the scripts work under python 3.
